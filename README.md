# Diabetes-Prediction

Dataset Utilization: Employs the PIMA Diabetes Dataset, analyzing data specific to diabetes prediction.

Data Loading and Handling: Demonstrates how to load data into a pandas DataFrame and explores the basic properties and structure of the dataset.

Comprehensive Data Analysis:
Initial exploration of data with simple data view commands.
Detailed statistical analysis to summarize central tendencies, dispersion, and the shape of the datasetâ€™s distribution.
Breakdown of data by outcomes to understand the distribution of diabetic vs. non-diabetic cases.
Data Preprocessing: Discusses and implements preprocessing techniques such as normalization or scaling if applicable, to prepare the data for modeling.

Use of Python Libraries:
NumPy: For numerical operations.
pandas: For data manipulation and retrieval.
scikit-learn: For applying machine learning algorithms, including data preprocessing and possibly model evaluation.

Predictive Modeling: Outlines steps for building a predictive model (if included in the further sections of the notebook), focusing on selecting the right model, training, and evaluation metrics.

Visualization: Includes visualization of data and results using matplotlib or seaborn to provide insights into the data (if these sections are included).
